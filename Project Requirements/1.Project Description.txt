Problem Description

I have developed a simple quiz game with 25 questions in total having 4 options each.

The game consists of 7 user faced activities which are
1)Launch Screen
2)Game Menu
3)Play Now
4)You Won
5)High Scores
6)Settings
7)About

I was able to add the following features:

-List View(non clickable) in HighScores
-SQLite Database with add,delete and update functions
-Async Task for database read and write
-Share intent in YouWon activity
